SE500 Reminder Bot

Reminder bot is the tool of the decade to thrust twenty-first century students into the new age. Modern students are spending more hours than ever before in front of screens- on average 7 hours a day. This equates to over two thousand hours per year in front of screens! Attention and focus is quickly becoming the currency of our digital society. The vision behind reminder bot is to utilize the devices students are already spending most of their time in front of as a way to further assist them towards remembering their responsibilities and obligations.
